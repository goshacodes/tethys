package tethys.writers.tokens

/** Configuration for [[tethys.writers.tokens.DefaultTokenWriter]] that contains
  * params for formatting of output JSON and for tuning of preferred size for
  * internal byte buffer that is created on the writer instantiation and reused
  * in runtime for serialization of messages using any type of output except
  * pre-allocated byte arrays or heap byte buffers supplied as arguments. <br/>
  * All configuration params already initialized to default values, but in some
  * cases they should be altered: <ul> <li>turn on pretty printing by specifying
  * of indention step that is greater than 0</li> <li>turn on escaping of
  * Unicode characters to serialize with only ASCII characters</li> <li>increase
  * preferred size of an internal byte buffer to reduce allocation rate of grown
  * and then reduced internal buffers when serialized output size is greater
  * than 32Kb</li> </ul>
  * @param throwWriterExceptionWithStackTrace
  *   a flag that allows to turn on a stack traces for debugging purposes in
  *   development
  * @param indentionStep
  *   a size of indention for pretty-printed formatting or 0 for compact output
  * @param escapeUnicode
  *   a flag to turn on hexadecimal escaping of all non-ASCII chars
  * @param preferredBufSize
  *   a preferred size (in bytes) of an internal byte buffer when writing to any
  *   type of output except pre-allocated byte arrays or heap byte buffers
  *   supplied as arguments
